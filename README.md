## Emoji Encoding Challenge

#### Release 1:

In _emoji_encode.rb_ write a method that takes in a string and returns it transformed into emoji code! The file _emoji_key.rb_ has a legend for translating string letters, whitespace, and punctuation to emojis. That legend is available in both files. You can use it by using its variable name `KEY`.

To run the program type `ruby runner.rb` into the console.

Hint: Strings can be turned into arrays with `.split()` and arrays can be turned into strings with `.join()`


#### Release 2:

In _runner.rb_ comment out (put a # in front of `emoji_encode()`) and uncomment (remove the # infront of `emoji_decode()`). In _emoji_decode.rb_ write a method that takes in an emoji code and decodes the following  messages!
